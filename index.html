        <div class="subheading mb-5">EconomicsðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi. I am a second year student at the University of California, Riverside, studying Economics. I am originally from Walnut, California. 

<br><br>

        I am currently interested in becoming a managerial consultant. In Economics, I am challenged to understand several concepts and their applications. I am presented problems and must understand why. I find it very fulfilling and want to apply this to my future career as a consultant. I am interested in companies such as Deloitte, KPMG, and Mckinsey. 

<br><br>

        I am interested in politics, photography, and volunteer work.<br><br>
        
       In high school, I was apart of my high schoolâ€™s newspaper and yearbook staff. I enjoyed writing news articles and taking photos. I would write editorials that connected political and current issues to our campus. In addition, I would try can capture pictures that were captivating and told a story. I would enter journalism competitions that can be an award for my editorial writing and news photography. <br><br>

        I continue to volunteer for Operation Smile, a medical non profit that provides free surgeries to children and young adults with cleft lips and cleft palates. Through my work in Operation Smile, I have been able to travel to Seattle, Washington and Rome, Italy. In addition, I had the privilege to serve on a medical mission in the Dominican Republic in the Spring of 2016. There, I taught parents and children the importance of healthcare practices such as washing hands and brushing teeth. 
<br><br>
        
        In addition, I am involved in local politics. I was an Intern for my State Senator, Josh Newman. I work closely with my friend and Mayor Andrew Rodgriguez. I helped campaign for Treasurer John Chiang in his bid for California Governor. I find it important to stay up to date with current events. I like staying informed. 
<br><br>

        Today, I am an accounting assistant at the University of California, RIversideâ€™s Business and Financial Services. I work at the UC path Center. I work within the Accounts receivable department and help it pay off outstanding debts. This has been an incredible workplace experience. 
<br><br>
        
        Now at the University of California, Riverside, I serve in the Associated Students of the University of California, Riverside within the finance and sustainability committee. Every week, I help approve general fund to school organizations. We help them with their budgets and give advice on how to grow their organization. In addition, in Green Campus Action Plan, the sustainability committee, we find new ways to raise awareness and create events. We give out a lot of free stuff, like scantrons and blue books.<br><br>

        Some important classes I have completed here at UCR include: Introduction to Microeconomics, Introduction to Macroeconomics, Financial Accounting, Introduction to Business Principles, and Intermediate Microeconomic Theory. I believe these classes have given me the preparation to pursue consulting, finance, or accounting positions. 

<br><br>
        
        In the future, I hope to be more involved in ASUCR. I hope to gain more experience in whatever opportunity presents itself. I plan on becoming more educated in my major and build up more skills for the workforce.<br><br>
